Problem Statement:
Every year, millions of tons of food are wasted during social gatherings such as weddings, corporate events, and parties.
In India alone, over 40% of the food prepared for events goes to waste, even though 194 million people go hungry every day.

The core issue is lack of a fast, reliable, and connected system between event organizers and local NGOs.

>When guests don’t show up, large quantities of food remain unused.

>There’s no real-time communication channel to quickly inform NGOs about the surplus.

>By the time food is redistributed, it often becomes unsafe for consumption.

This results in avoidable food wastage and missed opportunities to feed the needy.


Proposed Solution — FoodLink
We propose FoodLink, a real-time web & mobile platform that connects event organizers with nearby NGOs instantly.

How it works:
1.Event Organizer posts surplus food details (type, quantity, pickup location, time window).

2.System uses GPS to notify nearby registered NGOs within a certain radius.

3.First NGO to accept gets assigned the pickup.

4.Real-time tracking allows organizers to see when the NGO picks up the food.

5.Food safety checks & verification badges ensure trust and quality.


Key Features That Make it Stand Out:
>Instant Matching Algorithm → Automatically finds the nearest NGO in seconds.

>Real-time Alerts → Push notifications for both parties.

>Food Safety Guidelines → Built-in checklist before pickup.

>Impact Dashboard → Shows how much food was saved and how many people were fed.

>Multilingual Support → For inclusivity in rural and urban areas.


Impact:
>Reduces food wastage significantly.

>Feeds hundreds of people per event who would otherwise go hungry.

>Strengthens NGO–community relations.

Future scopes:
1.Advanced AI Food Quality Detection
>Improve the AI model to detect spoilage with higher accuracy using image, smell, and temperature data.
>Add IoT sensors (humidity, temperature, gas sensors) for real-time food monitoring.

2.Blockchain-based Food Tracking
>Use blockchain to record and track the journey of surplus food (from donor → NGO → consumer).
>Ensure transparency and trust among donors, NGOs, and beneficiaries.

3.Geo-based Smart Matching
>Implement AI-powered geolocation to auto-match donors with nearest NGOs to reduce transport time.
>Optimize routes for quick delivery with logistics integration (Google Maps API).

4.Mobile Application Expansion
>Launch Android & iOS apps for wider accessibility.
>Enable instant push notifications for food availability.

5.Partnerships & Scalability
>Collaborate with restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets at scale.
>Partner with government food security programs and CSR initiatives.

6.Gamification & Incentives
>Introduce a reward/credit system for donors (tax benefits, CSR points, leaderboard).
>Encourage continuous engagement through achievements & community recognition.

7.Multi-language Support
>Add support for regional languages for wider adoption in India and globally.

8.Data Analytics & Reports
>Provide NGOs and government with dashboards showing food saved, CO₂ reduction, and number of people fed.
>Use predictive analytics to estimate future food needs.

9.Integration with Payment & Donation Systems
>Allow users to contribute money if they can’t donate food.
>NGOs can use funds for logistics and food preservation.

10.Global Expansion
>Scale the platform to other developing countries facing similar hunger and food waste challenges.
